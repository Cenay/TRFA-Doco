# ActiveCampaign Platform







## Help Ticket

I am trying to determine how to resend an email that was originally sent from an automation (in history sidebar) to the customer who's record I am positioned to. 

I've read this blog post: https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000168624-How-do-I-resend-an-automation-email-to-a-single-contact- but it's not helpful for our present situation, although I will build this one for my client as soon as I submit this ticket. But he has dozens of automations. Building a "resend this email" for the dozens is going to be painstaking! 

He is coming from InfusionSoft (at my recommendation) and that was one of the features he used a lot and is not happy to be "giving up".

Here is what we need to know:

I've searched help. The slack channel, Google and your blog and that blog post was the only one to answer my question. Is it on your roadmap? Please?

## Slack Query in #General

Hey all, have a question I hope someone here has already dealt with, or can suggest a direction. (Please forgive the large text block to explain). I am looking for a way to "resend" an email that was a part of an automation setup. The email shows up in the "history" (Activities) for a customer. I want to a) Resend that email, b) Direct it to another email address (for the same client, at their request). 

Our previous platform (InfusionSoft) has a one click solution. Click "Resend" next to the email title in the history tab. Sweet. ActiveCampaign, I can't find anything like that. 

I did find a blog post* about "resend" that involves setting up a one-off automation with no trigger that I manually add that customer to. However,  there are two serious downsides to that. 

a) You have to first create the one-off automation to add them to (and this client has dozens of automations!) 
b) You can't send it to another email address. 

Suggestions? Direction's to look?

## IDEAS Suggestion

We have a use case where the customer's frequently request we "resend" an email they claim that didn't receive (they did, and opened and deleted it), or want sent to a new email address. 

The email's in question were sent as a part of an automation. Since we need the information requested in the email (things like a headcount for a party, or a list of allergies for kids at an upcoming Kids Cooking Birthday Party), it is important we have a way to resend the request when they call. 

I've read this blog post: https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000168624-How-do-I-resend-an-automation-email-to-a-single-contact-  but it's not helpful for our present situation, although I will build this one for my client as soon as I submit a ticket. But he has dozens of automations. Building a separate "resend this email" for the dozens is going to be painstaking!
