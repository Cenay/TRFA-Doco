# Adult Classes
This event type wasn't covered in InfusionSoft campaigns, so there is nothing to port over. Leaving it for now. Address when time allows.

### Tags we'll need in the future?:
Adult Class  ( - Adult Day) (- Adult Evening)
  * Adult Day Purchased
  * IF/ELSE Adult Evening Purchased
  * Client Type . Adult Class
  * Anything else?

# Questions Preventing Creation of the Automations
 * The adult classes don't have a hook point, and the type of class (by date) isn't documented. Can we pull from Bookeo based on date somehow to tell AC what they took? 
 * Can the message be more generic in nature?  
 * What should the langauge be? Get with Art to see his thoughts.
