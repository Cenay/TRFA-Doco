# Newletter Draft Creation
Each month TRFA sends out 2 newsletters to their customers base. One geared towards Kids, and another for the Adults.


## Schedule
The draft setup of each of the two newsletter should be completed no longer than the 24th of the month PRIOR to the Newsletter "Month". (ie: January 2020 must be completed by Dec 24th, 2019) 

It may be produced earlier, or done in segments as long as the final result is complete by the 24th.
